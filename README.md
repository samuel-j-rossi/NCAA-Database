# NCAA-Database
As a final project for “CSC 4480: Principles of Database Systems” at Villanova University, I created a database with the purpose of tracking various statistics from the 2021 NCAA Big East Tournament for the purpose of statistical analysis. This database contains all players in the tournament with their average performance statistics calculated by their performances in each game played.
Queries included in the repository display tha cababilities of the database.
